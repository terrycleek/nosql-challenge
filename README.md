Some Help provided by TA Bill especially with parts 
-2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
Had issue where my RatingValue being turned into a interger from previous notebook was not being carried over to the next notebook because I linked a new json file directly into new notebook.

Had to reference some of the solutions guide at the end of analysis for trouble with query matching and sorting.
